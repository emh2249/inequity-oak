          <p>
            As I grew up in the Bay Area, I was always warned never to go to certain parts of Oakland. However, I hadn’t realized the negative media presence that the city of Oakland had as news drove the city and community to not only be burdened on an economic standpoint, but also a social standpoint. Even now, articles inundate the internet with articles that warn visitors of this crime-ridden city.
          </p>
          <p>To elaborate the social stigma that the city of Oakland is characterized by, a comparison will be made with the neighboring city of Piedmont, CA. With Piedmont’s demographic in terms of race as 78.6% White, 1.2% Black or African American, .1% American Indian, 16% Asian, and 3% Hispanic or Latino, and Oakland’s demographic that varies significantly (shown in Figure 1), we note how the race of a community can drastically change depending on chosen neighborhood, as well as the reputation that comes along.

              <p>
                As we evaluate the drastic difference in the median household income comparing Piedmont to Oakland, there are several factors that must be taken into account. When determining an attractive livable neighborhood space, many people of all ages take into account crime rate, economic opportunities, and if the household has children, other factors that are taken into account are primary and secondary school availability, safety, and accessibility to parks.

              <p>
                Focusing on crime rate, data found by the Oakland Police Department reveals the number of violent crimes per officer, as well as unshown weekly crime reports. We must note that crime report are not synonymous to represent actual crime, but rather the occasions in which the surrounding residents believe to define crime. Whether or not that term crime fits the appropriate description of an actionable crime should be evaluated more in-depth, however, for the purpose of this article, we will be considering crime at the surface level.

              <p>
                Based on seeing violent crimes per officer comparative to fifty other cities with high crime rates, Oakland is notably one of the highest according police reports collected. However, high crime rate is not a sole determinant in quantify someone’s preference in living space. The reputation that Oakland carries is unfortunately rising, as seen in the figure below. Comparative to the other highest violent crimes per officer, we see that the statistic for Oakland is still rising.

              <p>
                To draw back to our display in median household income in comparison to Piedmont, a closely neighboring city, the drastic inequity is evident and while the charter city of Piedmont has no particular responsibility in this inequity, the city must understand its impact on economic opportunity and social perspective of Oakland.
